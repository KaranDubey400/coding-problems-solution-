You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            
            // Check which part is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Left part is sorted
                if (target >= nums[left] && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                // Right part is sorted
                if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Target not found
    }
};
